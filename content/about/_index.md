# Welcome to Mocalabs!

Hello and welcome to Mocalabs: Blog of Abhilasha Figueroa. This is a personal blog, built with Hugo, that serves three main functions:
1. To write about my work as a sort of portfolio/landing page.
2. To write about computing topics I find interesting (which will likely be centered around Linux and other FOSS).
3. A place for me to occasionally write about music. After all, my life as a musician predates my life as a computer nerd by a handful of years. 

If you'd like to drop me a message, send me some hate mail, or [correct me on something where I am wrong](https://xkcd.com/386/), you can do so at abhilasha [dot] figueroa [at] protonmail [dot] com.
