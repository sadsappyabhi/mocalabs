This is the first post for this new blog.

Back in 2009, I created my first blog at the suggestion of [Mark Flugge](https://markflugge.com/), who told me upon turning in my final paper for his Jazz Styles & Analysis course, "You know, you are a very gifted writer. I would encourage you to continue writing after you graduate, regardless of whether it is about music or something completely different!"

Today, I am both a musician and a software developer. My primary interests as a developer are low-level systems programming and all things DevOps. As a musician, I gravitate towards harsh noise and free jazz. If you're into that sort of thing, you can find documentation of my musical output [here](https://www.abhiche.com/).

While this may be alienating to my potential audience, I do not see a very compelling reason to separate my writing between musical and computer science subjects -- sorry not sorry if you're only here for one of those subjects and are forced to wade through another that doesn't interest you. It's my blog and I'll do what I want!

That's all for now. Oh, except for me to make a plug real quick (...) It is absolutely ludicrous for me to brag about a former professor telling me I'm a decent writer when you consider the fact that I had the privilege of being a classmate of [Dan DiPiero](https://www.dandipiero.com/) whose writing voice makes me weep for how [*expletives removed*] brilliant it is. What a true hero and an inspiration to us all hashtag blessed.
