# Mocalabs

Hello and welcome to Mocalabs. This is a personal blog, built with Hugo, that serves three main functions:
1. To write about my work as a sort of portfolio/landing page.
2. To write about topics I find interesting (which will mostly be centered around Linux and other FOSS)
3. A place to occasionally write about music. My life as a musician does, in fact, predate my life as a computer nerd by just a couple of years.
